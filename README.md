# Dagoba-FSharp

[EXPERIMENTAL]
[INCOMPLETE]

A basic and changed port of [Dagoba](https://github.com/aosabook/500lines/tree/master/dagoba) from [500 Lines or Less](http://aosabook.org/en/500L/dagoba-an-in-memory-graph-database.html).

## Differences

The differences between the original Dagobda and Dagobda F# mirror the difference between JavaScript and F#.
The code is written in a strongly-typed and immutable way because of this there are some major differences.

- Unable to add arbitrary node or edge objects
  - TODO: Examples
- Adding a node or edge creates a new graph DB
  -TODO: Examples
- Unable to dynamic add pipeline

There are two things I viewed as out of scope for this project: Serialization and Persistance.
I was interested in the implementation of the graph database only.
I might add those features in the future.

## Examples

## Comparisions

Some comparisions to the original Dagoba and other graph DBs for fun.
